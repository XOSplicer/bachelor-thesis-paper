\chapter{Design and Methodology}
\label{chap:design}
This chapter describes which research method is used to design a solution 
that answers the initial questions posed in the first chapter.
The considerations that contribute to the design of this solution are outlined 
and form the foundation for its implementation in the next chapter.

\section{Employed Methodology}

Preceding to the practical part of this thesis, 
the method to follow along shall be laid out here.
One suitable method is the general concept of \emph{design science research}, also known as \emph{constructive research}, 
since it involves the development and evaluation of artifacts to solve domain specific problems.
It therefore conveys a improved practical relevance in comparison to purely descriptive research methods,
while the outcomes still create scientific knowledge
\autocite[][p.~v]{dresh2015designresearch}.
The conducted research must design an artifact, such as a construct, model or method, that solves a relevant problem in a specific field, which is evaluated regarding its utility, quality and efficacy.
The performed research should be based on rigorous scientific methods and contribute to the current theoretical body of knowledge.
The conducted design process must take into account the practical environment it is executed in and use the available resources.
A conclusion of the project for both technology-oriented as well as management-oriented audiences should be presented in the end
\autocite[][p.~70]{dresh2015designresearch}.

Figure \ref{fig:design:designscience} displays the steps that are found in the process of design science research. 
Those are the steps that guide the execution of this thesis.
The awareness and relevance for the given problem has already been given in section \vref{sec:into:context}.
Looking back to the original research questions (see section \vref{sec:intro:goals}) two focuses have been identified for this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which computer vision techniques can be used to detect persons and objects within an elevator car and in front of the lift and estimate their spacial volume?
    \item How can the information acquired by a system that uses such methods constitute to the optimization of algorithms that control the movement plan for elevators?
\end{itemize}


To answer the two questions, the conducted research is therefore twofold.
The first part involves the design and experimental implementation of a system to gather passengers volume data in elevators.
The second part deals with the integration of this information into a scheduling algorithm.
Outlined below are the steps that are taken to
suggest a tentative design for each, develop the artifacts and evaluate them.

For the  design and implementation of a vision system to gather volume data of passengers,
the following steps are performed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a typical or actual elevator control system architecture and define the positions to integrate the necessary components for an vision system into it.
    \item Define the exact type and structure of the information that the vision system should be able to detect.
    \item Find an algorithmic approach to  passenger detection and volume estimation that is suitable to generate the required data.
    \item Match the approach with an possible hardware setup to perform tests with it.
    \item Test the proposed detection system in an real world experiment that includes  exemplary footage from within an cabin.
    \item Evaluate the results of the test for the functionality and effectiveness of the employed system.
\end{enumerate}

For the integration of the passenger data into an existing scheduling algorithm the following steps are performed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define a suitable elevator configuration that could possibly benefit from the information that the vision system can provide. 
    Find a typical or actual control algorithm that is used for such a configuration.
    \item Adapt the scheduling algorithm to use the additional information.
    \item Compare the two versions of the algorithm in order to determine their effectiveness regarding a suitable metric.
    A simulation is used to perform this comparison.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test Arrangement and Validation Strategy}
To show the general feasibility of the approach described above, 
a real live test is performed.
For this test an exemplary office elevator is used.
Inside it, multiple cameras are mounted at the walls, 
all viewing the center of the cabin.
The cameras do not capture a live stream that is processed but record a video for later processing.
Four cameras are used in the test configuration.
One mounted to the center of each wall of the elevator, in a height of 150~cm.
These cameras are therefore positioned at a right angle towards each other.
An additional camera is mounted over the entry door within the elevator, also facing the center of the elevator.

During the performance of the test there are multiple scenarios
of passengers residing in the cabin:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empty cabin
    \item Single passenger in multiple positions in the cabin
    \item Multiple passengers in multiple positions in the cabin
    \item Single passenger with a large cargo object in the cabin
    \item Multiple passengers with a large cargo object in the cabin
\end{itemize}
TODO

A typical approach to evaluate the performance of an 
quantitative algorithm in computer vision is to compare it against the \emph{ground truth} present in the observed scene.
The ground truth is a description of the scene in the same format which the algorithm produces, however it is generated by inspection of the original scene by a human.
If the description consists of data for which an order exists, this order can be used for evaluation of the capability of the system.
In general however, the data that is compared might be arbitrarily complex and therefore it is not always possible to perform the comparison quantitatively. Rather a human has to decide, how \enquote{good} the produced results are.


\section{Scheduling Algorithm}
TODO
\subsection{Suitable Elevator Configuration}
Since the camera system is suitable to detect passengers as well as cargo objects,
it seems reasonable to apply the passenger information 
to a scheduling algorithm of an elevator system which conveys both of them.
This hold the opportunity to have a bigger impact the performance of the system, 
in contrast to applying it to a passenger-only lift.

Looking back at the categorization of elevators, cargo lifts meet this specification.
Typically an office building has one or multiple cargo lifts depending on its size,
but grouping them is uncommon \autocite[][p.~167]{barney2016handbook}.
A weight capacity of at least 1,600 kg is typical \autocite[][p.~167]{barney2016handbook},
but also capacities of 5,000 kg are possible \autocite[][]{kone2017overview}.
Typical application areas for cargo lifts are hospitals, where patients and beds are moved,
auxiliary lifts in office buildings and multi-story industrial buildings.
The typical control algorithm is collective control or sequential control \autocite[][pp.~238,~244]{barney2016handbook}.
For this comparison the sequential control and collective control will be taken as a baseline.

\subsection{Adaption of Scheduling Algorithm}




TODO

Therefore a new control strategy is proposed here, which will be called \emph{adaptive control} in the following. 
The strategy is a combination of collective control and sequential control.
It follows these simple rules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item When no cargo item is present in the cabin, the elevator is operated in collective mode and picks up and delivers passengers according to the collective control strategy.
    \item When there is a cargo item present in the cabin, deliver it directly to its destination car call, regardless of other car calls and hall calls.
\end{itemize}

TODO
This implies the necessarity to associate the cargo item to its car call. 
This association can be determined from the combination of the video data and car call data.

\subsection{Preparation for Simulation and Validation Strategy}

TODO
three algorithms:
sequential control
collective control
adaptive control

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If there is an active car call, mote to is respective floor, open the doors, unload the passenger, close the door and 
\end{enumerate}

describe pseudo code of the three strategies here
