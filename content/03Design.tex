\section{Employed Methodology}
TODO


- volume detectoin might hold the opportunity to further improve efficiency with the degree of usage on elevators
- limited by 80\% oder auch 60-70\% rule \autocite[][p.~194]{unger2015aufzuege} ??, unused capacity (referece)
- also detection of bigger items such as janitors cars, baby buggies  might be useful

come back to research questions an look onto what strategy is used to answer them

design science research / constructive research

two fold:
1. design and implementation of system to gather volume data of passengers
 - find current system architecture
 - define positions to integrate new components
 - define what information should come out of the system
 (eg passenger nnumbers, position, tracking, volume, other objects)
 - find and choose standard algorithms for passenger detection and volume estimation in visual system (taken from fundamentals)
 - match algorithm and hardware setup possibilities
 - implement detection system
 - test detection system exemplary by filming an elevator cabin and the outside (detection system not yet influencing the elevator system)
 
2. integration of volume passenger data into existing scheduling algorithm
 - define suitable elevator configuration that can benefit from solution (taken from fundamentals) 
 - find standard algorithm for this configuration (taken from fundamentals)
 - find an integration point for the data gathered by 1.
 - compare the two algorithms effectiveness by running a simulation with the same parameters for both to check if it is even relevant to use this advanced information

\section{Requirements}
TODO

\autocite[][]{xang2016trafficlist} has done tehe same and patentet it :(

\section{Conduction of Method}
TODO the method determines which steps to take
TODO, choose possible approach from sota
