\section{Elevator Movement}

\subsection{System Classifications}
- by amount of elevators
- by type of sensory to haul the car

\subsection{Measu}

\subsection{Movement Patterns}

TODO how many elevators parallel
TODO time of day eg. upstream, down stream, cross stream
TODO additional travel information: how many people inside and outside, up / down / floor select inside / outside, everyone presses?, video? 
destination control system

criteria: waiting time for passengers, riding time for passengers, capacity utilization, energy consumption, roundtriptime other times

ca 80\% oder auch 60-70\% maximal load on car, could be lower if objects in it
space vs wheight utilization

model building etc: here is a lot of research in the topic utilizing theoretical multivariable model optimization, simulational approaches and heuristical approaches in real world (refs?)

ISO standarts regarding lifts ISO4190 / EN 81
