\subsection{Implementation of Simulation}

TODO

The simulation is implemented in the \emph{Rust} programming language.
Rust is a programming language initially developed by Mozilla.
According to its website it is a \enquote{systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety} \autocite{rust2018rust}.
It features an expressive static type system and can be used to build applications that take advantage of modern hardware
\autocite[][]{matsakis2014rust}.
The rust compiler targets common platforms and operating and compiles source code to native machine code.
The language is chosen, since the author is proficient in it.

Rust comes with a build tool and package manager named \emph{cargo}.

TODO
general program flow:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the \texttt{BuildingParameters b}, \texttt{LiftParameters l} and\\ \texttt{SimulationParameters s}.
    \item Generate \texttt{s.simulations} many traffic \texttt{TrafficGenerator} instances, which each generates a traffic pattern. A traffic patterns describes the arrivals of traffic items for each tick of the simulation period. A Poisson distribution can be used to determine the amount of traffic items that arrive within this tick \autocite{beers2015arrivals}.
    \item For each traffic patterns, run the simulation with the three different scheduling strategies. Each simulation is given the same parameters (\texttt{b, l, s}) and the same traffic pattern. The procedure to run a single simulation is described below.
    \item Collect the results of all simulations and filter out the results of any run, where any of the three strategies produced an invalid result.
    5. Calculate the specified metrics by aggregating all the results for each strategy.
\end{enumerate}

TODO
to run a single simulation with a control strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a new \texttt{ElevatorSystem e}, which holds the system state to be altered during the simulation.
    \item Create an empty \texttt{SimulationResults} metric container, which will aggregate the metrics for this run.
    \item While \texttt{e.ticks < s.total\_ticks()}, repeat the following simulation cycle:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Ask the control strategy for an action to be performed on the elevator system based on the current state of said system and the internal state of the control strategy.
        The action can be one of the actions listed as \texttt{ControlAction}.
        \item Perform the given action on the elevator system, thereby updating all fields effected by this action.
        \item Calculate the time it took to perform those action on the system and advance the ticks accordingly.
        \item Update the  metrics about waiting and ride time for each traffic item that is currently in the floor queues or in the elevator. Also update the metrics about the number of delivered traffic items and elevator stops.
        \item Copy the traffic item form the traffic pattern into the floor queues, which arrived in the time between the last tick and the updated tick.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Correct the gathered metrics by removing the ride times of traffic items, who did not arrive at their destination yet and waiting times of traffic items, who did not yet enter the elevator.
\end{enumerate}

By running the  implemented simulation, the results displayed in table \ref{tab:impl:simulationresults} are gathered.
It is visible, that the three scheduling algorithms have distinct manifestations of the metrics that are recorded.
The sequential control sets focus on low ride time, the collective control sets focus on a balance between wait and ride time while maintaining a high delivery rate. 
The adaptive control strategy favours the delivery of cargo objects with lower ride times, while trading for a higher waiting time.
The key takeaways, expressed in relative numbers, here are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adaptive control delivers \textbf{more cargo items} on average than sequential control (\texttt{+}40.13~\%) and collective control (\texttt{+}35.52~\%).
    \item Collective control (\texttt{+}58.27~\%) and adaptive control (\texttt{+}61.53~\%) deliver \textbf{more passengers} on average compared to sequential control. 
    \item Sequential control shows a drastically higher mean waiting time then the other two (\texttt{+}1568.09~\%, \texttt{+}1297.55~\%). However a it features a lower average ride time (\texttt{-}76.41~\%, \texttt{-}71.09~\%), which is is only linear dependent on the travel distance.
    \item Adaptive control shows a slightly higher average waiting time (\texttt{+}30.56~\%) but has a lower (\texttt{-}18.40~\%) average ride time, which is less spread (\texttt{-}18.46~\%) compared to collective control.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion

TODO conclusion for efficiency and feasibility



\section{Economic Considerations}
TODO

- possible use cases -> multistory buildings with a elevator that is used by passengers as well as cargo objects, thinkable are (1) hospitals with elevators that are also used by patient beds, (2) multistory warehouses with cargo lifts, (3) office buildings with auxiliary lifts used by janitors with their carts
- possible customers -> Thyssen, Otis, Kone
- cost structure from hardware and software -> hardware necessary: 4 wide angle non-hd cameras per cabin, beefy computer to process the images (one per elevator or per group), cables, electricity, interconnection to group / elevator controller. software necessarry: image processing, connection to group / elevator controller, adapted scheduling software => moderatly priced hardware, real cost is durable and consistent software, many developer hours are needed
- savings possible from improved scheduling: cargo gets priority therefore cargo is delivered faster. having cargo in the cabin can hinder passengers from entering, therefore giving priority can increase overall capacity utilization which increases throughput -> lower energy needs per passenger / cargo
- build costs: visual system can be sold as optional feature for new elevators, or can be sold as upgrade to existing, can be sold at a premium



\section{Privacy Considerations}
Installing a camera system unavoidably raises privacy and security concerns 
for the individuals that are being filmed.
Especially in elevators, which are publicly accessible, there are legal requirements to fulfill.
In Germany the Federal Data Protection Act, \ac{BDSG} \autocite[][]{bmjv2009bdsg}, 
regulates the usage of video surveillance systems.
Public areas may only observed for specified purposes and the presence of a surveillance system must be indicated,
as well as the name and contact of its controller. 
When the data gathered by the system is no longer needed for the specified purpose, it must be deleted 
\autocite[][§~4]{bmjv2009bdsg}.
The European \ac{GDPR} \autocite{eu2016gdpr} describes similar, more broad principles:  
\emph{data transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, storage limitation and confidentiality}
\autocite{ico2018gdpr}.
Oriented at this principle the following paragraphs provide privacy consideration about the visual system.

The presented visual system has a \emph{limited purpose}, in that it is only used 
to determine whether passengers or cargo items are present in the elevator cabin 
and what volume they take up. 
These information is used to improve the scheduling of the elevator.

In order to keep the usage of video data \emph{transparent},
passengers should be informed about the video system before they enter the cabin.
This could be done by installing a sign, which indicates the presence of the video system, 
clearly states, for what purpose the video data is used for, 
and who is operating the system and can be contacted in case of issues.
The sign should be in front and inside of the elevator, 
so that potential passengers can decide,
if they want to use the lift and be filmed.

Since the system has a limited purpose, 
only data specific to that purpose should be gathered and processed.
The data usage should be \emph{minimized}.
Only as few cameras as possible, but as many as necessary should be installed in the lift.
Areas that are not of interest for the lift system should not be filmed.
Furthermore the resolution of the cameras should be only as high as necessary.
For purpose of detecting the presence, position and outline of a passenger or cargo object 
in the cabin, it is not required to capture fine details.
The DIN EN 62676-4 norm \autocite[][]{din2016surveillance} recommends 
to use a camera resolution, which captures 25 to 62.5 pixel per meter,
for the purpose of detecting or monitoring people.
In addition the kind of processing of the video data should be limited to the extend neccesary for the purpose of the video system. 
For example it is not necessary to perform face detection, or to identify individuals.
However tracking the path of an individual over the course of their journey might be beneficial for the application.

The presented system can operate in real time.
Only the current video frame is needed to determine the presence and volume of passengers and objects.
Therefore the \emph{storage} of the video data can be \emph{limited}.
There is no need to store the video data at all.

In order to keep the video data \emph{confidential}, 
measures must be taken to prevent access by unauthorized parties.
For the purpose of the system, all data processing can be done locally within the elevator system.
The visual system only needs to interact with the elevator controller.
Therefore there is no need to make the data available to the outside, e.g. the internet.
Doing so would open up unnecessary possibilities for misuse of the video system.
