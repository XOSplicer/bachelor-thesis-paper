\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:concl}

This chapter summarizes the outcomes of the thesis at hand 
and reflects on the conducted methods.
Key ideas of the previous chapters are pointed out and a discussion regarding the solution quality and alternative solutions is held.
Lastly a suggestion for the next steps at DXC Technology regarding the utilization of this thesis is given.

\section{Summary}

In this thesis first the theoretical background in \ac{2D} and \ac{3D} computer vision have been explained.
After that two major artifacts have been designed, created and evaluated by following the principles of design science research.
Primarily a design for a volume recognition system inside elevator cabin has been conducted.
The system uses techniques which include foreground-masking by background subtraction with the \ac{MOG} method and most importantly the technique of voxel based volume intersection.
The system was partially implemented and tested on a real elevator cabin.



TODO
we saw:


- the thoughts that go into simulating an elevator system
- a new scheduling algorithm suited for cargo lifts used by passengers and cargo
which prioritizes cargo, 
- the performance evaluation of this algorithm in the simulation
-according to own simulation it delivers 35.52~\% more cargo than collective control, and has a 18.40~\% lower average wait time but comes at the cost of a 30.56~\% higher waiting time.
- possible use cases include hospitals, auxiliary lifts and fabrication plants

\section{Discussion and Critical Reflection}

TODO Discussion regarding outcomes
TODO Discussion regarding external Results
discussion regarding initial questions
discussion regarding alternative solutions
Discussion of simulation parameter, strategy and programflow correctness, discussion of simulation output corecctness

TODO  Discussion regarding internal Execution and chosen methods


\section{Further Work}

TODO
this project: possible to do mathematical correct and complete implementation
but how needs this is far from production ready
dxc: try to get customers interested and develop new ideas with them based on this work
team up with computer vision experts if necessary
