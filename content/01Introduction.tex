%\section{Computer Vision and Elevators}

The usage of elevator constructions to lift goods and people vertically dates back a long history and gained significant importance since the industrialization.
Nowadays modern high-rise buildings would not be sustainable without elevation systems appropriate to handle large amount of business people on their way to and from the office. 
The issue of optimizing the throughput of passengers and reducing the their waiting time is of everyday economic interest since it is critical for the business people using it to use their time most efficiently. 
Therefore the topic of movement optimization for elevators is under active academic research with direct impact for manufacturers.
Such optimizations of the control mechanism depend on many parameters including timings of the system, the traffic patterns of the passengers and the kind of input mechanisms to detect passengers and terminal destination.

In this thesis a possibility to enhance this control mechanism by utilizing computer--based camera vision is proposed.
Currently the general trend of computer vision is emerging in many fields with real--world applications
and techniques of varying complexities are employed to support a broad range of use cases such as survialance,
smart home, monitoring and statitical applications




TODO


- general intro to why camera vision is gaining importance in public places for survialance, statistics, monitoring live reactrion. 
- iot mevement with cameras and many other sensors
- and why elevator movement is an topic of economic interest.


\section{Context}

- andere paper referenzieren vorheriger research?
- DXC, digital service innovation team, Startup autobahn
- startup nicht mehr da, kunde abgesprungen??

\section{Motivation}


TODO


where does the problem come from?
why is this work relevant?
auch wenn der kunde weg ist, will DXC weiter das thema verfolgen und damit zu möglicher weiteren kunden gehen und vllt dazu startups ins boot holen
volume detectoin might hold the opportunity to further improve efficiency with the degree of usage on elevators
limited by 80\% oder auch 60-70\% rule ??, unused capacity
also detection of bigger items such as janitors cars might be useful


mögliche kunden Otis, Kone, Thyssen, Schindler (nennbar?)
